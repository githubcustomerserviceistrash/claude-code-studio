# ITERATIVE WORKFLOW PATTERNS - Agent Independence Framework

**Purpose**: Enable agents to autonomously iterate until optimal results are achieved or clear limitations are reached.

**Core Philosophy**: "Iterate to excellence, escalate only on boundaries"

---

## 1. UNIVERSAL ITERATIVE FRAMEWORK

### Core Pattern: E-H-A-E-D-R Cycle

```yaml
universal_cycle:
  examine: "Current state analysis with measurable baseline"
  hypothesize: "Specific improvement theory with success criteria"
  act: "Minimal viable change implementation"
  evaluate: "Quantitative result measurement against baseline"
  decide: "Continue iterating, escalate, or declare complete"
  repeat: "Next cycle with updated context and learnings"
```

### Stopping Criteria Framework

```yaml
completion_triggers:
  success_achieved:
    - condition: "All success criteria met or exceeded"
    - verification: "Quantitative evidence of target achievement"
    - action: "Document final state and implementation"
    
  diminishing_returns:
    - condition: "Improvement rate below threshold for 3+ cycles"
    - threshold: "< 5% improvement per iteration"
    - action: "Present current state as optimal within constraints"
    
  resource_limits:
    - condition: "Time/token budget approaching limits"
    - threshold: "80% of allocated resources consumed"
    - action: "Prioritize most impactful remaining iterations"
    
  technical_boundaries:
    - condition: "External constraints preventing further improvement"
    - examples: ["API rate limits", "framework limitations", "hardware constraints"]
    - action: "Document limitations and recommend architectural changes"
    
  complexity_ceiling:
    - condition: "Next improvement requires architectural changes"
    - threshold: "Implementation effort > 2x current cycle effort"
    - action: "Escalate to human for strategic decision"
```

### Success Metrics Framework

```yaml
quantitative_metrics:
  performance:
    - response_time: "< target_milliseconds"
    - throughput: "> target_operations_per_second"
    - resource_usage: "< target_cpu_memory_percentage"
    
  quality:
    - error_rate: "< target_error_percentage"
    - test_coverage: "> target_coverage_percentage"
    - code_quality_score: "> target_quality_threshold"
    
  user_experience:
    - accessibility_score: "> 90%"
    - usability_metrics: "task_completion_rate > 95%"
    - visual_consistency: "design_system_compliance > 98%"

qualitative_validation:
  code_review:
    - readability: "Junior developer can understand in < 5 minutes"
    - maintainability: "Changes require < 3 files modification"
    - testability: "New tests added for all changes"
    
  user_interface:
    - intuitive_navigation: "No user guidance needed for primary tasks"
    - visual_hierarchy: "Clear information architecture evident"
    - responsive_design: "Optimal experience across device types"
```

### Escalation Triggers

```yaml
human_intervention_required:
  strategic_decisions:
    - condition: "Multiple viable solutions with significant trade-offs"
    - examples: ["Architecture patterns", "Technology stack choices"]
    - escalation: "Present options with quantified pros/cons"
    
  business_logic_ambiguity:
    - condition: "Requirements interpretation affects implementation"
    - examples: ["Edge case handling", "User workflow assumptions"]
    - escalation: "Request clarification with specific scenarios"
    
  external_dependencies:
    - condition: "Third-party service limitations blocking progress"
    - examples: ["API restrictions", "Service outages", "Rate limiting"]
    - escalation: "Document limitations and propose alternatives"
    
  security_implications:
    - condition: "Changes affect security model or data access"
    - examples: ["Authentication flows", "Data encryption", "Permission models"]

## AGENT IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Iteration Setup
- [ ] Clear goal definition with measurable success criteria
- [ ] Baseline measurement and documentation
- [ ] Iteration budget and resource allocation
- [ ] Escalation triggers and contact methods

### During Iteration
- [ ] Single-variable change implementation
- [ ] Consistent measurement methodology
- [ ] Progress documentation and decision logging
- [ ] Continuous evaluation against stopping criteria

### Post-Iteration
- [ ] Results analysis and interpretation
- [ ] Decision documentation (continue/escalate/complete)
- [ ] Learning capture for future iterations
- [ ] Stakeholder communication as appropriate

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Quantitative evidence for all decisions
- [ ] Reproducible measurement methodology
- [ ] Clear audit trail of changes and rationale
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation planning

**Remember**: The goal is autonomous excellence, not human dependency. Iterate until you achieve optimal results or reach clear boundaries that require human guidance.
