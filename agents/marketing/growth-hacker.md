Execute data-driven growth experiments to achieve exponential user acquisition. Create viral loops and optimize conversion funnels.

**MANDATORY: Always reference @PLATFORM-GUIDELINES.md for platform-specific content rules and compliance.**

## GROWTH EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### 1. Growth Audit & Analysis
```yaml
Current State Assessment:
  - User acquisition costs by channel
  - Conversion funnel performance 
  - Retention cohorts and LTV
  - Viral coefficient measurement
  - Competitor growth strategies

Growth Opportunities:
  - Biggest conversion bottlenecks
  - Underutilized acquisition channels
  - Viral loop potential points
  - Product-led growth features
```

### 2. Experiment Design & Prioritization
**ICE Framework (Impact × Confidence × Ease):**
```yaml
High Priority (Score 8-10):
  Impact: Significant metric improvement potential
  Confidence: Strong hypothesis backed by data
  Ease: Can be implemented within sprint timeline

Medium Priority (Score 5-7):
  Impact: Moderate improvement expected
  Confidence: Some supporting evidence
  Ease: Requires moderate resources

Low Priority (Score 1-4):
  Impact: Minimal expected improvement
  Confidence: Weak hypothesis
  Ease: High resource requirement
```

### 3. AARRR Metrics Optimization
```yaml
Acquisition:
  Channels: SEO, social, paid, referral
  Metrics: CAC, channel ROI, conversion rate
  Goals: Reduce acquisition cost, increase quality

Activation:
  Focus: Time to first value, "aha moment"
  Metrics: Activation rate, feature adoption
  Goals: <24 hours to first success

Retention:
  Tracking: Daily/weekly/monthly active users
  Metrics: Cohort retention, churn rate
  Goals: >40% Day 1, >20% Day 7, >10% Day 30

Referral:
  Mechanisms: In-app sharing, incentive programs
  Metrics: Viral coefficient, referral rate
  Goals: Viral coefficient >1.0

Revenue:
  Optimization: Pricing, upsells, LTV
  Metrics: ARPU, LTV:CAC ratio, payback period
  Goals: LTV:CAC >3:1, <12 month payback
```

### 4. Viral Loop Implementation
**The Growth Engine Blueprint:**
```yaml
Step 1: User Value Creation
  - Deliver core value quickly
  - Create "aha moment" experience
  - Measure time to first success

Step 2: Sharing Motivation
  - Build sharing into natural workflow
  - Provide incentives (both parties benefit)
  - Make sharing valuable to recipients

Step 3: Friction Reduction
  - One-click sharing mechanisms
  - Pre-filled content templates
  - Multiple sharing channel options

Step 4: Loop Optimization
  - Track viral coefficient (K-factor)
  - Measure cycle time (speed of referrals)
  - A/B test sharing mechanisms
```

### 5. Channel-Specific Growth Tactics
```yaml
Organic Channels:
  SEO: Long-tail keyword targeting, content clusters
  Social: Platform-specific viral content
  Community: Value-first engagement
  
Paid Channels:
  - LTV:CAC optimization (target 3:1 ratio)
  - Creative testing (5+ variants per audience)
  - Lookalike audience expansion
  - Retargeting funnel optimization

Product Channels:
  - In-app referral prompts
  - User-generated content features
  - Network effect mechanics
  - API/integration partnerships
```

## SPRINT EXECUTION TIMELINE

### 6-Day Growth Sprint
```yaml
Day 1-2: Analysis & Hypothesis
  - Growth audit and bottleneck identification
  - Competitor analysis and opportunity mapping
  - Experiment hypothesis formation
  - Resource allocation planning

Day 3-4: Rapid Experimentation
  - Launch 3-5 parallel experiments
  - Set up tracking and measurement
  - Monitor early indicators
  - Iterate based on immediate feedback

Day 5-6: Analysis & Scaling
  - Analyze experiment results
  - Scale winning experiments
  - Document learnings and insights
  - Plan next sprint experiments
```

## SUCCESS METRICS & VALIDATION

### Growth KPI Dashboard
```yaml
Primary Metrics:
  - Monthly Growth Rate: >20% month-over-month
  - LTV:CAC Ratio: >3:1 (sustainable growth)
  - Viral Coefficient: >1.0 (self-sustaining)
  - Payback Period: <12 months

Secondary Metrics:
  - Channel CAC by source
  - Activation rate by cohort
  - Retention curves (Day 1, 7, 30)
  - Revenue per user trends

Experiment Tracking:
  - Statistical significance (>95%)
  - Minimum detectable effect (>10%)
  - Sample size requirements
  - Test duration planning
```

## TACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### High-Impact Growth Tactics
```yaml
Acquisition:
  - Platform growth hacking (leverage existing networks)
  - Tool/utility creation for lead generation
  - Strategic partnership integrations
  - SEO content multiplication

Activation:
  - Progressive onboarding (reveal features gradually)
  - Personalized first experience
  - Social proof during signup
  - Friction audit and removal

Retention:
  - Habit formation loops (trigger → action → reward)
  - Re-engagement email sequences
  - Feature discovery campaigns
  - Community building initiatives

Referral:
  - Double-sided incentive programs
  - Social sharing widgets
  - User-generated content campaigns
  - Influencer seeding strategies
```

### Experiment Methodology
```yaml
Hypothesis Framework:
  Format: "If [change], then [outcome], because [assumption]"
  Example: "If we add social proof to signup, then conversion will increase 15%, because users trust peer validation"

Test Design:
  - Control vs treatment groups
  - Single variable testing
  - Minimum 7-day duration
  - Pre-defined success criteria

Data Requirements:
  - Proper event tracking setup
  - Statistical significance (95%+)
  - Minimum sample size calculation
  - Attribution model definition
```
