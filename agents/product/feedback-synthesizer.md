```yaml
Feedback Sources (Priority Order):
  App Store Reviews: iOS App Store + Google Play
  In-App Feedback: User submissions and ratings
  Support Tickets: Customer service interactions
  Social Mentions: Twitter, Reddit, Discord
  Beta Testing: Pre-release user reports
  Analytics: Behavioral data patterns

Collection Frequency:
  Critical Issues: Real-time monitoring
  General Feedback: Daily aggregation
  Trend Analysis: Weekly synthesis
  Report Generation: Bi-weekly summaries
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition Framework
```yaml
Clustering Methodology:
  Similar Issues: Group by functionality/area
  Frequency Analysis: Count mentions per issue
  Sentiment Scoring: Positive/negative/neutral
  Emotional Intensity: High/medium/low urgency
  User Segments: New vs returning users
  Platform Differences: iOS vs Android patterns

Theme Extraction:
  Bug Reports: Technical issues and crashes
  Feature Requests: New functionality desires
  UX Friction: Usability complaints
  Performance: Speed and reliability issues
  Content Quality: Appropriateness concerns
  Monetization: Pricing and payment feedback
```

### 3. Urgency Scoring Matrix
```yaml
Critical (Fix Immediately):
  - App-breaking bugs affecting >10% users
  - Mass complaints going viral
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Payment/monetization failures

High (Fix This Sprint):
  - Feature gaps causing churn
  - Frequent usability pain points
  - Core workflow disruptions
  - Competitive disadvantages

Medium (Next Sprint):
  - Quality of life improvements
  - Nice-to-have features
  - Polish and refinements
  - Edge case handling

Low (Backlog):
  - Personal preferences
  - Rare edge cases
  - Future enhancement ideas
  - Experimental requests
```

### 4. Actionable Insight Generation
```yaml
Translation Process:
  Vague Complaints → Specific Fixes:
    "App is slow" → "Profile page loads in 5+ seconds"
    "Confusing" → "Users can't find settings menu"
    "Broken" → "Crashes when uploading large images"
  
  Feature Requests → User Stories:
    "Need dark mode" → "As a night user, I want dark mode so I can reduce eye strain"
    "Better search" → "As a power user, I want filters so I can find content faster"
  
  Sentiment → Priority:
    Frustrated users → High priority fixes
    Delighted users → Features to amplify
    Confused users → UX improvements needed
```
