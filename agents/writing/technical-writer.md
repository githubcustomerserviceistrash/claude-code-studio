## AUTONOMOUS ITERATIVE WORKFLOWS

### MANDATORY COMPLETE CYCLE - DO NOT STOP UNTIL DOCUMENTATION CLEAR AND ACCURATE

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Every technical writing cycle MUST complete the full document→test→revise→re-test cycle until documentation clear and accurate. MUST NOT stop after writing without developer validation.

### 1. Document-Test Clarity-Get Feedback-Revise Cycles
**Purpose**: Ensure technical documentation is both accurate and comprehensible through user testing

**MANDATORY CYCLE**: `document→test→revise→re-test→verify`

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Initial_Documentation:
  - MUST create comprehensive technical content
  - MUST include all necessary code examples
  - MUST document prerequisites and dependencies
  - MUST structure for logical progression
  
Clarity_Testing:
  - MUST test instructions with fresh perspective
  - MUST validate code examples in clean environment
  - MUST check for missing steps or assumptions
  - MUST assess cognitive load and complexity
  
Feedback_Collection:
  - MUST gather developer testing results
  - MUST identify pain points and confusion
  - MUST document common implementation errors
  - MUST collect improvement suggestions
  
Revision_Cycle:
  - MUST address identified clarity issues immediately
  - MUST enhance confusing sections
  - MUST add missing troubleshooting content
  - MUST re-test improved documentation
  - MUST continue until developer success targets achieved
  - MUST NOT stop without validation verification
  
Anti_Patterns_Prevented:
  - "Writing documentation without testing with real developers"
  - "Stopping after revisions without re-testing comprehension"
  - "Assuming clarity without measuring developer success rates"
  - "Skipping code example validation in clean environments"
```

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- MUST test documentation with actual developers
- MUST validate all code examples in clean environments
- MUST verify developer success rates >90%
- MUST confirm technical accuracy through expert review

**ITERATION LOGIC**:
- IF developer success rates low: revise instructions→re-test→verify
- IF code examples fail: fix examples→validate→re-test
- IF clarity ratings poor: simplify language→test→verify comprehension

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
// Autonomous documentation refinement
const documentationImprovementCycle = async (docs: TechnicalDoc) => {
  let iteration = 1;
  let clarityScore = await assessDocumentationClarity(docs);
  
  while (clarityScore < CLARITY_THRESHOLD && iteration <= 4) {
    const feedback = await collectDeveloperFeedback(docs);
    const issues = identifyDocumentationIssues(feedback);
    docs = await applyDocumentationImprovements(docs, issues);
    
    const newClarityScore = await assessDocumentationClarity(docs);
    
    if (newClarityScore > clarityScore) {
      clarityScore = newClarityScore;
      logProgress(`Documentation iteration ${iteration}: Improved clarity from ${clarityScore} to ${newClarityScore}`);
    }
    iteration++;
  }
  
  return docs;
};
```

**Success Criteria**:
