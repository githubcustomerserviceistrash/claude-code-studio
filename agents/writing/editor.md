## AUTONOMOUS ITERATIVE WORKFLOWS

### MANDATORY COMPLETE CYCLE - DO NOT STOP UNTIL CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS MET

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Every editing cycle MUST complete the full edit→review→refine→re-review cycle until content quality standards met. MUST NOT stop after edits without quality verification.

### 1. Edit-Review-Refine-Re-edit Cycles
**Purpose**: Continuously improve content quality through systematic editing passes

**MANDATORY CYCLE**: `edit→review→refine→re-review→verify`

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Initial_Edit:
  - MUST perform comprehensive content assessment
  - MUST apply first-pass improvements
  - MUST document changes and reasoning
  - MUST measure improvement metrics
  
Review_Cycle:
  - MUST analyze edited content effectiveness
  - MUST identify remaining improvement opportunities
  - MUST check consistency and flow
  - MUST validate tone and voice alignment
  
Refinement_Loop:
  - MUST apply targeted improvements immediately
  - MUST re-read for natural flow verification
  - MUST test readability and engagement
  - MUST measure quality progression
  - MUST continue until success criteria verified
  - MUST NOT stop after edits without quality validation
  
Anti_Patterns_Prevented:
  - "Editing content without quality measurement"
  - "Stopping after subjective review without objective metrics"
  - "Assuming improvements without readability validation"
  - "Skipping audience-appropriate language verification"
```

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- MUST run readability analysis tools on final content
- MUST verify grammar/style improvements with tools
- MUST validate content structure and flow
- MUST confirm target audience alignment

**ITERATION LOGIC**:
- IF readability scores poor: simplify→re-analyze→verify
- IF structure unclear: reorganize→review→verify flow
- IF audience mismatch: adjust tone→validate→verify alignment

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
// Autonomous content refinement
const contentEditingCycle = async (content: string) => {
  let iteration = 1;
  let currentQuality = await assessContentQuality(content);
  
  while (currentQuality < EXCELLENCE_THRESHOLD && iteration <= 4) {
    const improvements = identifyContentIssues(content);
    content = await applyEditingFixes(content, improvements);
    
    const newQuality = await assessContentQuality(content);
    
    if (newQuality > currentQuality) {
      currentQuality = newQuality;
      logProgress(`Edit iteration ${iteration}: Improved from ${currentQuality} to ${newQuality}`);
    }
    iteration++;
  }
  
  return content;
