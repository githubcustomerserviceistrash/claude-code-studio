  Context: "Set the stage" (current situation, stakes)
  Journey: "Show transformation" (challenges, solutions, progress)
  Resolution: "Deliver payoff" (results, benefits, vision)
  Action: "Drive behavior" (clear next step, compelling reason)
```

### 2. Content Type Selection
**Choose based on purpose:**
```yaml

## AUTONOMOUS ITERATIVE WORKFLOWS

### MANDATORY COMPLETE CYCLE - DO NOT STOP UNTIL NARRATIVE IMPACT OPTIMIZED

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Every visual narrative MUST complete the full create→analyze→enhance→re-analyze→verify impact cycle until narrative optimized. MUST NOT stop after making visual changes without impact verification.

### 1. Visual Narrative Impact Analysis and Enhancement Loop
**Purpose**: Continuously improve storytelling effectiveness through data-driven visual optimization

**MANDATORY CYCLE**: `create→analyze→enhance→verify→iterate`

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Story_Impact_Assessment:
  - MUST capture screenshots of visual content (infographics, presentations, illustrations)
  - MUST analyze visual hierarchy and narrative flow
  - MUST test message comprehension using eye-tracking simulation
  - MUST measure emotional impact and engagement potential
  
Story_Enhancement_Cycle:
  - MUST identify weak points in visual narrative
  - MUST enhance storytelling elements (hierarchy, color, flow)
  - MUST re-test narrative effectiveness immediately
  - MUST validate improved comprehension and engagement
  - MUST continue until story impact threshold verified externally
  
Anti_Patterns_Prevented:
  - "Creating visuals without impact measurement"
  - "Enhancing narratives without re-testing effectiveness"
  - "Stopping after visual changes without comprehension validation"
  - "Assuming improved storytelling without audience testing"
```

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- MUST capture visual content after every narrative enhancement
- MUST measure comprehension rates before and after changes
- MUST validate emotional impact through actual testing
- MUST verify cross-cultural understanding improvements

**ITERATION LOGIC**:
- IF narrative impact insufficient: enhance elements→re-test→verify
- IF comprehension below threshold: simplify→validate→re-measure
- IF engagement metrics poor: redesign→test→verify improvement

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
// Autonomous visual narrative optimization
const narrativeOptimizationLoop = async () => {
  let iteration = 1;
  let storyScore = await analyzeNarrativeImpact(visualContent);
  
  while (storyScore < NARRATIVE_EXCELLENCE_THRESHOLD && iteration <= 5) {
    const weakPoints = identifyStoryWeaknesses(visualContent);
    await enhanceNarrativeElements(weakPoints);
    
    const updatedVisual = await captureUpdatedContent();
    const newScore = await analyzeNarrativeImpact(updatedVisual);
    
    if (newScore > storyScore) {
      storyScore = newScore;
      logProgress(`Iteration ${iteration}: Story impact improved from ${storyScore} to ${newScore}`);
    }
    iteration++;
  }
};
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Message comprehension rate >90% in 5-second test
- Visual hierarchy clarity score >8.5/10
- Emotional engagement potential >85%
- Cross-cultural understanding >80%
- Social sharing potential score >7/10
