## WORKFLOW EXECUTION

### 1. Design Analysis
- Assess existing design patterns and components
- Identify reusable elements and design tokens
- Document current visual hierarchy and spacing
- Note platform-specific requirements (iOS/Android/Web)

### 2. Rapid Interface Creation
1. **Start with existing components** - Use Tailwind UI, Shadcn/ui as base
2. **Apply 8px grid system** - All spacing in 8px increments
3. **Design mobile-first** - Optimize for touch targets and thumb reach
4. **Create component variations** - Default, hover, active, disabled, loading states
5. **Specify exact values** - Tailwind classes, hex colors, spacing units

### 3. Visual System Development
```css
/* Design Token Structure */
Colors: Primary, Secondary, Success/Warning/Error, Neutrals
Spacing: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px
Typography: 12px/14px/16px/20px/24px/30px/36px
Corners: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px

## AUTONOMOUS ITERATIVE WORKFLOWS

### MANDATORY COMPLETE CYCLE - DO NOT STOP UNTIL VISUAL VERIFICATION COMPLETE

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Every UI iteration MUST complete the full design→screenshot→analyze→improve→re-screenshot→verify cycle. MUST NOT stop after making changes without visual confirmation.

### 1. Design-Screenshot-Analyze-Improve Cycle
**Purpose**: Continuously refine UI designs through visual feedback loops

**MANDATORY CYCLE**: `design→screenshot→analyze→improve→re-screenshot→verify`

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Initial_Design:
  - Create UI mockup/implementation
  - MUST take actual screenshot via Playwright
  - Analyze visual hierarchy, spacing, alignment
  - Identify improvement opportunities
  
Iteration_Loop:
  - Apply specific improvements
  - MUST re-screenshot updated design immediately
  - MUST compare before/after visually
  - MUST verify actual visual improvements
  - MUST continue until success criteria verified externally
  
Anti_Patterns_Prevented:
  - "Making UI changes without visual verification"
  - "Assuming improvements without screenshot comparison"
  - "Stopping after CSS changes without rendering validation"
  - "Skipping cross-device/browser verification"
```

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- MUST capture fresh screenshots after every UI change
- MUST compare before/after visuals for improvement validation
- MUST verify responsive behavior across viewport sizes
- MUST validate accessibility improvements with actual tools

**ITERATION LOGIC**:
- IF visual improvement insufficient: refine design→re-screenshot→verify
- IF accessibility issues detected: fix→validate→re-screenshot
- IF responsive issues found: adjust→test viewports→verify

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
// Autonomous design refinement
const designIteration = async () => {
  let iteration = 1;
  let currentScore = await analyzeDesignQuality(screenshot);
  
  while (currentScore < DESIGN_EXCELLENCE_THRESHOLD && iteration <= 5) {
    const improvements = identifyDesignIssues(screenshot);
    await applyDesignFixes(improvements);
    
    const newScreenshot = await takeScreenshot();
    const newScore = await analyzeDesignQuality(newScreenshot);
    
    if (newScore > currentScore) {
      currentScore = newScore;
      logProgress(`Iteration ${iteration}: Improved from ${currentScore} to ${newScore}`);
    }
    iteration++;
  }
};
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Visual hierarchy score >8.5/10
- Accessibility contrast ratio >4.5:1
- Touch target compliance >44px
- Spacing consistency >95%
- Brand guideline adherence >90%

### 2. Design System Compliance Auto-Checker
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent design token usage across all interfaces

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Compliance_Scan:
  - Screenshot all app screens
  - Extract color, spacing, typography values
  - Compare against design system tokens
  - Flag inconsistencies and violations
  
Auto_Fix_Loop:
  - Apply design token corrections
  - Re-scan for compliance
  - Validate visual integrity maintained
  - Update design system if needed
```

**Tools Integration**:
- **Playwright**: Screenshot capture and element inspection
- **Serena**: Find design token usages in codebase
- **Sequential-thinking**: Analyze design consistency patterns

**Stopping Criteria**:
- Design token compliance >98%
- Zero hard-coded color/spacing values

```

**Metrics Tracking**:
- WCAG AA compliance score
- Color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation completeness
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicator visibility

### 4. Visual Hierarchy Optimization Loop
**Purpose**: Continuously improve information architecture and visual flow

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Hierarchy_Analysis:

  - Analyze eye-tracking patterns (simulated)
  - Identify visual weight distribution
  - Map user attention flow
  
Optimization_Iterations:
  - Adjust typography scale and weight
  - Refine spacing and grouping
  - Optimize color emphasis
  - Re-test visual flow effectiveness
```

**Implementation Tools**:

- Tablet (768-1024px): Balanced layout, gesture-friendly interactions
- Desktop (1024px+): Efficient space usage, hover state optimization
- Cross-device consistency >95%

### 6. Performance-Driven Design Optimization
**Purpose**: Balance visual appeal with loading performance and user experience

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Performance_Impact_Analysis:
  - Measure design element loading times
  - Analyze asset sizes and optimization opportunities
  - Test perceived performance and visual feedback
  - Identify performance bottlenecks in design
  
Performance_Enhancement:
  - Optimize image formats and compression
  - Implement progressive loading strategies
  - Design effective loading states and skeletons
  - Re-test performance metrics and user perception
```

**Performance Success Criteria**:
- First meaningful paint <1.5s
- Largest contentful paint <2.5s
- Cumulative layout shift <0.1
- Visual loading feedback for all interactions >200ms

### Escalation Triggers
**Human Intervention Required When**:
