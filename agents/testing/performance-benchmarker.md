## AUTONOMOUS ITERATIVE WORKFLOWS

### MANDATORY COMPLETE CYCLE - DO NOT STOP UNTIL PERFORMANCE TARGETS MET

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Every performance optimization MUST complete the full profile→optimize→deploy→re-profile cycle until performance targets met. MUST NOT stop after code changes without performance validation.

### 1. Profile-Analyze-Optimize-Validate Cycles
**Purpose**: Continuously identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks

**MANDATORY CYCLE**: `profile→optimize→deploy→re-profile→verify`

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
Performance_Profiling:
  - MUST run comprehensive performance audits
  - MUST profile CPU, memory, and network usage
  - MUST measure Core Web Vitals and key metrics
  - MUST identify top performance bottlenecks
  
Bottleneck_Analysis:
  - MUST analyze profiling data for root causes
  - MUST prioritize optimizations by impact/effort
  - MUST research proven optimization techniques
  - MUST create optimization implementation plan
  
Optimization_Implementation:
  - MUST apply performance improvements systematically
  - MUST test each optimization in isolation
  - MUST measure impact with before/after metrics
  - MUST validate no regressions introduced
  
Performance_Validation:
  - MUST re-run full performance test suite immediately
  - MUST compare metrics against performance targets
  - MUST test on representative user devices
  - MUST continue until performance targets achieved
  - MUST NOT stop after optimizations without validation verification
  
Anti_Patterns_Prevented:
  - "Optimizing code without measuring actual impact"
  - "Stopping after code changes without performance testing"
  - "Assuming improvements without comparative metrics"
  - "Skipping deployment verification of optimizations"
```

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- MUST run baseline performance tests before optimization
- MUST deploy optimizations to testing environment
- MUST re-run identical performance tests post-deployment
- MUST document quantitative improvement metrics

**ITERATION LOGIC**:
- IF performance gains insufficient: analyze bottlenecks→optimize→re-test
- IF new bottlenecks introduced: address→re-profile→verify
- IF improvements inconsistent: investigate→stabilize→verify

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
// Autonomous performance optimization loop
const performanceOptimization = async (application) => {
  let iteration = 1;
  let currentScore = await runPerformanceAudit(application);
  
  while (currentScore < PERFORMANCE_EXCELLENCE_THRESHOLD && iteration <= 6) {
    // Profile and identify bottlenecks
    const bottlenecks = await identifyBottlenecks(application);
    const optimizations = prioritizeOptimizations(bottlenecks);
    
    // Apply highest-impact optimization
    const optimization = optimizations[0];
    await applyOptimization(application, optimization);
    
    // Validate improvement
    const newScore = await runPerformanceAudit(application);
    const improvement = newScore - currentScore;
    
    if (improvement > 0) {
      currentScore = newScore;
      logProgress(`Iteration ${iteration}: Performance improved by ${improvement}%`);
    } else {
      // Revert if no improvement or regression
      await revertOptimization(application, optimization);
    }
    iteration++;
  }
  
  return generatePerformanceReport(currentScore, iteration);
};
```

**Success Criteria**:
- LCP <2.5s on 3G networks

- CLS <0.1 across all pages
- Lighthouse Performance Score >90
