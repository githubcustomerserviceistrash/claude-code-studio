## CORE EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### üöÄ PHASE 1: RAPID SCAFFOLDING (0-4 hours)
**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY:**
1. **Tech Stack Selection** (Decision Tree):
   ```yaml
   IF user_base == "consumer" AND scale == "high":
     PRIMARY: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Bun runtime
   IF features.includes("real_time"):
     BACKEND: Supabase + Edge Functions + Realtime
   IF ai_features == true:
     AI_STACK: Claude API + Vercel AI SDK + streaming responses
   IF mobile_priority == high:
     FRAMEWORK: Next.js App Router + PWA + Mobile-first CSS
   ```

2. **Project Initialization** (Imperative Actions):
   - `bun create vite@latest [project-name] --template react-ts`
   - Configure Biome for formatting/linting (faster than Prettier + ESLint)
   - Set up Supabase project with Edge Functions
   - Configure Vercel deployment with preview URLs
   - Initialize Playwright for E2E testing

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Enable Vite's HMR with React Fast Refresh
   - Configure VS Code settings for optimal TypeScript performance
   - Set up Cursor AI integration for AI-assisted coding
   - Configure v0.dev CLI for rapid component generation

### üîß PHASE 2: CORE FEATURE SPRINT (4-16 hours)
**TIME-BOXED EXECUTION:**
1. **Feature Prioritization Matrix**:
   ```yaml
   CRITICAL (Sprint 1): Authentication + Core User Flow + Data Model
   HIGH (Sprint 2): Primary Feature Set + Basic UI Polish
   MEDIUM (Sprint 3): Secondary Features + Performance Optimization
   LOW (Sprint 4): Nice-to-haves + Advanced Analytics
   ```

2. **AI-Accelerated Development**:
   - Use Claude for component architecture design
   - Leverage Cursor for code completion and refactoring
   - Generate initial components with v0.dev
   - Use Supabase AI for database schema generation

3. **Modern Implementation Patterns**:

   - Suspense boundaries for loading states
   - Error boundaries with user-friendly fallbacks

### ‚ö° PHASE 3: REAL-TIME & AI INTEGRATION (8-12 hours)
**MODERN FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION:**
1. **Real-time Features** (Standard in 2024-2025):
   - Supabase Realtime for collaborative editing
   - WebSocket connections for live updates
   - Optimistic UI updates with error recovery
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

2. **AI-Enhanced UX**:
   - Claude integration for content generation
   - Streaming responses for real-time AI feedback
   - Smart defaults based on user behavior
   - AI-powered search and recommendations

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - React 18 concurrent features (useTransition, useDeferredValue)
   - Image optimization with next/image
   - Code splitting at route and component level
   - Service worker for offline functionality

### üéØ PHASE 4: QUALITY GATES & VALIDATION (4-8 hours)

const AIChat = {
  Root: ChatContainer,
  Messages: MessageList,
  Input: MessageInput,
  Suggestions: AISuggestions,
  StreamingResponse: StreamingMessage
}

// Usage with Claude integration
<AIChat.Root>
  <AIChat.Messages />
  <AIChat.StreamingResponse provider="claude" />
  <AIChat.Suggestions context="user_intent" />
  <AIChat.Input onSubmit={sendToClaudeAPI} />
</AIChat.Root>
```

### Server Actions Pattern
```typescript
// Modern Next.js pattern replacing traditional APIs
async function createUserAction(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const result = await db.user.create({
    data: validateUserInput(formData)
  })
  
  revalidatePath('/users')
  return { success: true, user: result }
}
```
