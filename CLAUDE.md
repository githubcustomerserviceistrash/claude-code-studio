## Security and Access Control
MCP access is now restricted by agent type for security and performance optimization. Each agent has tailored MCP permissions based on their domain expertise and operational requirements.

These files contain enhanced Claude Code configuration with:
- Socratic questioning framework for requirement clarification
- Quality-first programming task planning templates
- Engineering standards and best practices
- Temp directory management for clean repositories
- Agent-specific MCP access control framework
- Iterative workflow patterns for autonomous improvement cycles enabling agents to work independently until optimal results are achieved
- Iterative cycle enforcement ensuring agents complete full test-fix-verify loops rather than stopping prematurely
- Orchestrator enhancement patterns for continuous questioning, clarification, and project documentation
