# ITERATIVE-CYCLE-ENFORCEMENT.md
## Mandatory Completion Patterns for All Iterative Agents

**Core Principle**: "NO PARTIAL CYCLES - COMPLETE THE LOOP OR DECLARE FAILURE"

---

## üîí MANDATORY CYCLE COMPLETION LANGUAGE TEMPLATES

### Universal Enforcement Commands
```yaml
CYCLE_START_TEMPLATES:
  - "MANDATORY COMPLETE CYCLE - DO NOT STOP UNTIL [SUCCESS_CONDITION] IS VERIFIED"
  - "MUST execute full [CYCLE_NAME] cycle: [STEP1]‚Üí[STEP2]‚Üí[STEP3]‚ÜíVERIFY"
  - "CYCLE INCOMPLETE until [EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION] confirms success"
  - "MUST NOT declare success without [ACTUAL_MEASUREMENT] showing improvement"

PARTIAL_STOP_PREVENTION:
  - "MUST NOT stop after [PARTIAL_STEP] - the cycle is incomplete without [REMAINING_STEPS]"
  - "Analysis/Planning phase complete but ACTION PHASE MANDATORY"
  - "Code changes made but VERIFICATION PHASE MANDATORY"
  - "Local fixes applied but DEPLOYMENT/TESTING PHASE MANDATORY"

VERIFICATION_ENFORCEMENT:
  - "MUST continue iterating until [ACTUAL_VERIFICATION] shows SUCCESS"
  - "MUST [ACTION] for actual [RESULT] completion before declaring success"
  - "MUST wait for [EXTERNAL_PROCESS] completion and verify [SUCCESS_METRIC]"
  - "MUST capture [EVIDENCE_TYPE] showing real improvement"

ITERATION_REQUIREMENTS:
  - "IF first iteration fails verification: MUST iterate with new approach"
  - "IF partial success detected: MUST continue until full success criteria met"
  - "IF external process pending: MUST wait and verify completion"
  - "Maximum [N] iterations before escalating or declaring systematic failure"
```

## üö´ COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS TO PREVENT

### Problem Analysis Without Action
```yaml
analysis_paralysis_prevention:
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "Detailed problem analysis followed by no implementation"
    - "Multiple solution options presented without execution"
    - "Root cause identified but fixes not applied"
    
  enforcement_language:
    - "Analysis complete - MANDATORY ACTION PHASE beginning"
    - "MUST implement [SOLUTION] before cycle completion"
    - "Problem identified - MUST NOT stop without resolution attempt"
```

### Fixes Without Testing/Verification
```yaml
fix_without_validation_prevention:
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "Code changes made without execution testing"
    - "Configuration updated without restart verification"
    - "Optimization applied without performance measurement"
    
  enforcement_language:
    - "Fixes applied - MANDATORY VERIFICATION PHASE required"
    - "MUST test changes before declaring success"
    - "Implementation complete - MUST verify actual improvement"
```

### Success Declaration Without External Confirmation
```yaml
premature_success_prevention:
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "Declaring success based on code changes alone"
    - "Assuming deployment success without confirmation"
    - "Claiming improvement without measurement"
    
  enforcement_language:
    - "Local changes complete - MUST verify external impact"
    - "CANNOT declare success without [EXTERNAL_CONFIRMATION]"
    - "Implementation phase done - MUST complete verification phase"
```

### Skipping Wait Periods for External Processes
```yaml
wait_period_enforcement:
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "Checking deployment status immediately after push"
    - "Testing changes before propagation completion"
    - "Verifying improvements before processing completion"
    
  enforcement_language:
    - "MUST wait [TIME] for [PROCESS] completion before verification"
    - "External process initiated - MANDATORY wait period required"
    - "CANNOT verify until [EXTERNAL_PROCESS] has sufficient time"
```

## üîÑ CYCLE COMPLETION VALIDATION

### Final Verification Checklist
```yaml
completion_requirements:
  all_steps_executed: "Every cycle step documented and completed"
  external_verification: "Independent confirmation of success obtained"
  metrics_improved: "Quantitative or qualitative improvement demonstrated"
  stability_confirmed: "Changes remain stable over monitoring period"
  documentation_updated: "Cycle execution and results documented"
  
failure_escalation:
  max_iterations: "After [N] iterations, escalate to human or supervisor agent"
  systematic_failure: "If fundamental approach fails, declare systematic issue"
  resource_constraints: "If external dependencies block completion, document constraints"
  timeout_conditions: "If cycle exceeds [TIME] limit, summarize progress and escalate"
```

### Success Declaration Template
```yaml
success_template: |
  üéØ ITERATIVE CYCLE COMPLETION REPORT

**ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE**: All iterative agents MUST adopt these patterns. No partial cycles permitted. Complete the loop or declare systematic failure.
